# READMEGenerator
MSU - Homework 09: README Generator (Node.js &amp; ES6)

## Overview
For this project I created a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md from the user's input using the Inquirer package.
This enables the project creator to spend more time working on finishing their project rather than spending time to create a good README for the repository.

The application can be invoked with the following command:

```
node index.js
```

## App Demo
